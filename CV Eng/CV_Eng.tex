\cvsection{Relevant Experiences}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Summer research internship in Dr. Xin Tong's Polarized Neutron group, May to July 2023. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item During this time, I collaborated with Dr. Tianhao (Radian) Wang and Dr. Ahmad Salman to develop a polarized neutron imager that can directly observe the magnetic field of a given sample in 3D.
            \item I was responsible for the design and implementation of various neutron-optical simulations and data analysis programs. One of these programs is a raytracing-based simulation that can simulate the detector's output when taking a snapshot of the sample under a diffusive neutron light source.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{University of Toronto Physics Student Union (UofT PhySU)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vice-President of Internal and External Affairs, 2023 to 2024 academic year.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{University of Toronto Aerospace Team (UTAT) Space Systems}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data Processing subsystem
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Since Feburary 2023, Keystone correction project team lead. I am responsible for eawrly feasibility study, progress tracking, and team management.
            \item Since September 2021, memmber of Smile correction project team. I was a part of a team that develops, implements, and tests an algorithm that removes smile distortion.
        \end{itemize}

        \item Mission Science subsystem (disbanded due to mission progress)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item General member, September 2021 to August 2022. Our task was scoping for alternative missions for the team's CubeSat project FINCH, which was published in the team's submission to Small Satellite Conference 2022.
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP) Exam}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From 2017 through 2019, I attended the CAP prized exam multiple times and ranked higher and higher in the province of Quebec each time. My highest rank was within top 10. 
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Moon Base Design Contest} by Moon Society, December 2020 to January 2021
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Captain and design lead of a finalist team;
        \item First author of the team's design paper.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Marianopolis Propulsion Laboratory}, a student rockety society at Marianopolis College, Montreal
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Co-executive, 2019 to 2020 academic years;
        \item Outreach director, 2018 to 2020.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Various tutoring jobs}, freelance, mid- to long-term, pro bono

\end{itemize}
